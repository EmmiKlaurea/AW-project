      <h2>3. Known Accessibility Issues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a student project, so the scope of accessibility testing has been limited.</li>
        <li>Screen reader testing has only been performed using NVDA.</li>
        <li>Some elements may not have full ARIA roles or states defined.</li>
        <li>Certain dynamic features, such as form error messages, may not yet be fully accessible to all assistive technologies.</li>
        <li>Improvements will be made where possible.</li>
        <li>When pressing number 1 on keyboard, Header 1 is not readable with a screen reader. Using the mouse, NVDA reads the heading. </li>
        <li> Data privacy and Terms of use -pages lead to external page without a warning. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Accessibility Evaluation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Manual keyboard testing</li>
        <li>Testing with the NVDA screen reader</li>
        <li>Automated testing for responsiveness using the Axe DevTools extension.</li>
        <li>Informal user testing with two individuals with visual impairments. Testing has been conducted with 5 people altogether to improve accessibility and usability. Most of the testing is made by content creater.</li>

      <h2>6. Enforcement Procedure</h2>
      <p>Since this is a student project and not an official website of a public organization, there is no formal enforcement procedure. However, all feedback is taken seriously and will be considered in future development work. If this was an official website, there could be a possibility to contact an appropriate authority which is Traficom in Finland.</p>
