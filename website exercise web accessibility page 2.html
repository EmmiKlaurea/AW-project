                     <p>I worked in customer service for eight years. After that, I wanted a change in my life. I started my own company, Emmi Tuominen Web Consulting Oy.

                    <br> as my day job. The best thing is that I can combine my experience of customer-centric thinking with creativity. Accessibility is very important
                    <br> for me because I genuinely believe that everyone deserves accessible and usable services.</p>
